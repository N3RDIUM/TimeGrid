# TimeGrid
A universal school time table management system I wrote in Python for my school.

## Motivation
Why am I doing this? Well, I think that conventional time tables used by schools have a much more *intuitive* alternative. Let the computer look at the data like a table. Human brains were not designed to quickly use tables. This project fixes that problem by representing a period as a bar on the time scale, which allows for more flexible time tables.

I am making this project for my school with love. I am looking forward to make more such things for my school and help my juniors as an ex-student.

## Planned features
- [ ] Fully flexible time table
- [ ] Flask backend, hosted on school server
- [ ] HTMX frontend, managed by flask templates
